# Why I Want to Be a Front-End Developer and How HNG Will Help Achieve My Goals
My Journey into Frontend Development
My tech journey began when I developed a strong interest in technology and programming. I began learning HTML, CSS,JavaScript and python through FreeCodeCamp and earned certifications in Responsive Web Design and JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures.

I love building while I learn, so I started exploring different libraries on Freecodecamp where I am currently learning Frontend develpoment libraries. Frontend development interests me, and I aim to become even more skilled and capable.

# Why I Joined HNG?
I joined HNG to network to gain experience, make friends and to challenge myself. I am new to tech and so, want to increase my skills by working on projects, meeting with other developers, and writing code. My experience with HNG thus far suggests it is an environment where I can grow and receive mentorship.

Also important is that HNG allows me work on real-life projects and connect with companies looking to hire React.js developers.

# My Goals for This Internship
Through HNG, I aim to:

Increase my skills in JavaScript, TypeScript, and React by working on complex projects.
Learn how to work around Frontend and other programming software.
Improve my ability to write secure and maintainablle Frontend code.
Increase my portfolio and learn from experienced developers.

# How I Plan to Achieve These Goals
Consistent Practice: I will actively build and refine projects assigned during the internship.
Learning from Mentors: Engaging with the HNG community will help me learn faster.
Contribute to real projects.
Staying updated on best practices and relevant trends.

Frontend development is not only about code — it’s about creating user experiences. As such, HNG is an opportunity for me to increase my skills, build projects, and prepare for a professional career. By the end of this internship, I plan to be well-equipped for Frontend expertise in order to secure roles as a JavaScript developer.
